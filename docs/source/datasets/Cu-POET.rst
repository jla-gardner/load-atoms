    Cu-POET:
        structures: 163
        atoms: 5,051
        species:
            Cu: 100.00%
        properties:
            per atom: (forces)
            per structure: (config_type, energy, stress)
    


Cu dataset, with DFT labels, originally used for training symbolic
interatomic potentials, using the POET framework (https://gitlab.com/muellergroup/poet).
Also included are a selection of low index surfaces for testing.
