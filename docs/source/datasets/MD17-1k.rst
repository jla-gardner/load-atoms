MD17-1k
=======

1k of randomly sampled training structures for each system from the MD17 dataset
(further split into 950 train and 50 validation), together with a further
1k test structures.
Exact code used to generate these structures is available 
`here <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/database/MD17-1k/process.py>`_.
Labels have been converted from the original units of kcal/mol to eV.
