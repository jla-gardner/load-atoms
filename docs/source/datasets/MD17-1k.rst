    MD17-1k:
        structures: 16,000
        atoms: 224,000
        species:
            H: 44.64%
            C: 42.86%
            O: 10.71%
            N: 1.79%
        properties:
            per atom: (forces)
            per structure: (system, energy, split)
    


1k of randomly sampled training structures for each system from the MD17 dataset
(further split into 950 train and 50 validation), together with a further
1k test structures.
Exact code used to generate these structures is available 
`here <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/database/MD17-1k/process.py>`_.
Labels have been converted from the original units of kcal/mol to eV.
