        A dataset composed of a single MD trajectory for each of 10 molecules.
        Original structures are taken from Chmiela et al., with energy and force
        labels recalculated by Christensen and von Lilienfeld using "the PBE/def2-SVP
        level of theory [with] very tight SCF convergence and [a] very dense DFT
        integration grid". The MD trajectories are presented one at a time, with
        structures within each trajectory in chronological order.
