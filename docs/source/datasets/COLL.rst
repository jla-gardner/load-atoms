        Version 1.2 of the COLL dataset, containing distorted configurations of small molecules during collisions. Original files were downloaded from `FigShare <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/COLL_Dataset_v1_2/13289165>`_. The train/val/test split information was added to each structure using the script available at `GitHub <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/database/COLL/script.py>`_. For more information, see: `Fast and Uncertainty-Aware Directional Message Passing for Non-Equilibrium Molecules <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14115>`_.
