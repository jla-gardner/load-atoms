        The complete Phosphorus dataset used to train the `P-GAP-20 <https://zenodo.org/records/4003703>`_ model from  `A General-Purpose Machine-Learning Force Field for Bulk and Nanostructured Phosphorus <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19168-z>`_. This dataset contains structures generated by GAP-RSS, together with liquids, crystals and isolated fragments. For more information about the dataset's construction, see the paper's `Supplementary Information <https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-020-19168-z/MediaObjects/41467_2020_19168_MOESM1_ESM.pdf>`_. Energy and force labels were calculated using DFT + MBD
