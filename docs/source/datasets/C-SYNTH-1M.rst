        One million unique atomic environments from a "synthetic" dataset of carbon structures. These structures, each containing 200 atoms, have been sampled from 546 uncorrelated MD trajectories driven by the `C-GAP-17 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.094203>`_ interatomic potential. Per-atom energy and force labels from the same potential are included. More details can be found in the paper: `Synthetic Data Enable Experiments in Atomistic Machine Learning <https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00137C>`_.
