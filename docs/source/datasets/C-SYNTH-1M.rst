    C-SYNTH-1M:
        structures: 5,460
        atoms: 1,092,000
        species:
            C: 100.00%
        properties:
            per atom: (gap17_energy, gap17_forces)
            per structure: (time, anneal_T, density, run_id)
    


1 million atomic environments from a "synthetic" dataset 
created using the C-GAP-17 model to 
drive MD for 546 uncorrelated configurations.
