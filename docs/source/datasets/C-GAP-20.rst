    C-GAP-20:
        structures: 6,088
        atoms: 400,275
        species:
            C: 100.00%
        properties:
            per atom: (force_U, force)
            per structure: (nneightol, energy_U, config_type, energy, cutoff)
    


The complete dataset and labels used for training both the `C-GAP-20 <https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/153/3/034702/1062660/An-accurate-and-transferable-machine-learning>`_
and C-GAP-20-U interatomic potentials for carbon. 
Original labels were obtained from `CAM.54529 <https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.54529>`_, 
and the higher level of DFT used for the C-GAP-20-U model was obtained from `CAM.82086 <https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.82086>`_.
