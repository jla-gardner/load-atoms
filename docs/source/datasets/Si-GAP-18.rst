        The complete dataset used to train the `Si-GAP-18 <https://zenodo.org/records/1250555>`_ model from `Machine Learning a General-Purpose Interatomic Potential for Silicon <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.041048>`_. The CUR algorithm was used to select representative structures from a larger dataset. Energy and force labels were calculated using DFT and the PW91 exchange-correlation functional.
