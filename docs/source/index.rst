=================


.. warning::

   This project is under active development. Until version 1.0.0 is released, breaking changes to the API may occur.

**L**\arge **O**\pen **A**\ccess **D**\atasets for **Ato**\mistic **M**\aterials **S**\cience

Use this python package to easily access datasets of atomic structures.

Installation
------------
.. _installation:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install load-atoms

Usage
-----

The main entry point to `load-atoms` is the :func:`dataset` function. This can be used to download any dataset that this package currently supports:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from load_atoms import dataset
   >>> structures = dataset("C-GAP-17-train")
   Downloading C-GAP-17.extxyz from https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/
   100.0% | ███████████████████████████████████████

   Complete training dataset for the C-GAP-17 model.

   This dataset is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
   If you use this dataset, please cite the following:
   @article{Deringer-17,
      title = {Machine learning based interatomic potential for amorphous carbon},
      doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.95.094203},
      volume = {95},
      number = {9},
      urldate = {2021-07-15},

      pages = {094203},
   }

:code:`structures` is a :class:`Dataset` object. This is a lightweight wrapper around a list of :class:`ase.Atoms` objects, and can be used as such:

.. code-block:: python

      >>> len(structures)
      4080
      >>> structures[0]
      Atoms(symbols='C64', pbc=True, cell=[9.483921, 9.483921, 9.483921], force=...)
