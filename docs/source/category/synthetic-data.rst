        Amorphous, 2D graphene structures generated using a Monte Carlo bond-switching algorithm,
        as described in the paper: `Exploring the Configurational Space of Amorphous Graphene with Machine-Learned Atomic Energies <https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/sc/d2sc04326b>`_.
        The data files were originaly obtained from `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/7221166>`_.

        One million unique atomic environments from a "synthetic" dataset of carbon structures.
        These structures, each containing 200 atoms, have been sampled from 546 uncorrelated MD trajectories
        driven by the `C-GAP-17 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.094203>`_ interatomic potential.
        Per-atom energy and force labels from the same potential are included.
        More details can be found in the paper: `Synthetic Data Enable Experiments in Atomistic Machine Learning <https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00137C>`_.

        The complete "synthetic" dataset of carbon structures from `Synthetic Data Enable Experiments in Atomistic Machine Learning <https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00137C>`_.
        This dataset comprises 546 uncorrelated MD trajectories, each containing 200 atoms, driven by the `C-GAP-17 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.094203>`_ interatomic potential,
        and sampled every 1fs. The dataset contains per-atom energy and force labels from the same potential.
