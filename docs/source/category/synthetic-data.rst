        Amorphous, 2D graphene structures generated using a Monte Carlo bond-switching algorithm,
        as described in Figure 3 of the paper: `Exploring the Configurational Space of Amorphous Graphene with Machine-Learned Atomic Energies <https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/sc/d2sc04326b>`_.
        Files are downloaded from `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/7221166>`_ and processed using
        a `custom script <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/src/load_atoms/database/processing/AC-2D-22.py>`_ to extract the structures and information.

        The complete "synthetic" dataset of carbon structures from `Synthetic Data Enable Experiments in Atomistic Machine Learning <https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00137C>`_.
        This dataset comprises 546 uncorrelated MD trajectories, each containing 200 atoms, driven by the `C-GAP-17 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.094203>`_ interatomic potential,
        and sampled every 1fs. The dataset contains per-atom energy and force labels from the same potential.
