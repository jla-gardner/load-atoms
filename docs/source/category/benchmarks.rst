        A collection of 7,165 saturated, small molecules containing up to 7 heavy atoms,
        with geometries relaxed using an empirical potential. Atomisation energies were calculated similarly to a FHI-AIMS implementation of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (PBE0).
        Original files were obtained from `quantum-machine.org <http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/>`_.
        Energies have been converted from kcal/mol to eV.

        134k stable organic molecules made up of CHONF and containing up to 9 heavy atoms.
        Each molecule's geometry was relaxed at the PM7 semi-empirical level of theory, before
        being labelled with DFT. 
        For more information, see `Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 
        134 kilo molecules <https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2014.22>`_.
        Internally, files are downloaded from `FigShare <https://figshare.com/collections/Quantum_chemistry_structures_and_properties_of_134_kilo_molecules/978904>`_, 
        and using a `custom script <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/src/load_atoms/database/processing/read_qm9_xyz.py>`__.
        Energy labels are quoted in eV, relative to the isolated atoms of the molecule.
