        Version 1.2 of the COLL dataset, containing distorted configurations of small molecules during collisions.
        Original files were downloaded from `FigShare <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/COLL_Dataset_v1_2/13289165>`_.
        The train/val/test split information was added to each structure using the script available at
        `GitHub <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/database/COLL/script.py>`_.
        For more information, see: `Fast and Uncertainty-Aware Directional Message Passing for Non-Equilibrium Molecules <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14115>`_.

        .. centered:: :doc:`MD17-1k <../datasets/MD17-1k>`
    
        1,000 randomly sampled training structures, together with 1,000 test structures, for each system from the `MD17 dataset <https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1603015>`_.
        Original data was downloaded from `sgdml.org <http://www.sgdml.org/#datasets>`_.
        Structure selection and data processing was performed using the script available 
        `here <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/database/MD17-1k/process.py>`_.
        As part of this process, energy and force labels have been converted from the original units of kcal/mol and kcal/mol/Å to eV and eV/Å, respectively.

        A collection of 7,165 saturated, small molecules containing up to 7 heavy atoms,
        with geometries relaxed using an empirical potential. Atomisation energies were calculated similarly to a FHI-AIMS implementation of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (PBE0).
        The original files were obtained from `quantum-machine.org <http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/>`_.
        Energies were converted from kcal/mol to eV.

            This dataset probes chemical reactions of methyl halides with halide anions, i.e. 
            :math:`\text{X}^- + \text{CH}_3\text{Y} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{X} +  \text{Y}^-` , and contains structures for all possible combinations of 
            :math:`\text{X},\text{Y} = \text{F}, \text{Cl}, \text{Br}, \text{I}`.
