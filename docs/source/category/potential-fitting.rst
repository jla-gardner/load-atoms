        .. centered:: :doc:`C-GAP-17 <../datasets/C-GAP-17>`
    
        The complete dataset and labels used to train and test the `C-GAP-17 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.094203>`_ 
        interatomic potential for amorphous carbon.
        This dataset was built in an iterative manner, and contains 4,530 structures, covering a wide range of densities, temperatures and degrees of dis/order.
        More detail can be found in the paper's `supplementary information <https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.7453>`_.

        .. centered:: :doc:`C-GAP-20 <../datasets/C-GAP-20>`
    
        The complete dataset and labels used for training both the `C-GAP-20 <https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/153/3/034702/1062660/An-accurate-and-transferable-machine-learning>`_
        and C-GAP-20-U interatomic potentials for carbon. 
        Original labels were obtained from `CAM.54529 <https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.54529>`_, 
        and the higher level of DFT used for the C-GAP-20-U model was obtained from `CAM.82086 <https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.82086>`_.

        .. centered:: :doc:`GST-GAP-22 <../datasets/GST-GAP-22>`
    
        The complete dataset used for training the `GST-GAP-22 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41928-023-01030-x>`_ interatomic potential,
        as labelled using the PBE functional.
        This dataset covers a range of compositions along the :math:`\text{GeTe} \rightarrow \text{Sb}_2\text{Te}_3` pseudo-binary line, and
        was created using a two-step iterative process. More details are available in the paper's `supplementary information <https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41928-023-01030-x/MediaObjects/41928_2023_1030_MOESM1_ESM.pdf>`_.
        The original data were obtained from `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/8208202>`_. DFT energy and force labels have been
        renamed to :code:`energy` and :code:`forces` respectively.

        .. centered:: :doc:`P-GAP-20 <../datasets/P-GAP-20>`
    
        The complete Phosphorus dataset used to train the `P-GAP-20 <https://zenodo.org/records/4003703>`_ model from 
        `A General-Purpose Machine-Learning Force Field for Bulk and Nanostructured Phosphorus <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19168-z>`_.
        This dataset contains structures generated by GAP-RSS, together with liquids, crystals and isolated fragments.
        For more information about the dataset's construction, see the paper's `Supplementary Information <https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-020-19168-z/MediaObjects/41467_2020_19168_MOESM1_ESM.pdf>`_.
        Energy and force labels were calculated using DFT + MBD

        .. centered:: :doc:`SiO2-GAP-21 <../datasets/SiO2-GAP-21>`
    
        The training database used to fit the `GAP-21 potential for silica <https://zenodo.org/records/6353684>`_ in: 
        `A Machine-Learned Interatomic Potential for Silica and Its Relation to Empirical Models <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-022-00768-w>`_.
        The dataset was generated using an iterative approach, in some cases driven by an emprical potential. More details are available in the 
        `supplementary information <https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41524-022-00768-w/MediaObjects/41524_2022_768_MOESM1_ESM.pdf>`_.
