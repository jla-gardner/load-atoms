    A collection of 7,165 saturated, small molecules containing up to 7 heavy atoms,
    with geometries relaxed using an empirical potential. Atomisation energies were calculated similarly to a FHI-AIMS implementation of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (PBE0).
    Original files were obtained from `quantum-machine.org <http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/>`_.
    Energies have been converted from kcal/mol to eV.
