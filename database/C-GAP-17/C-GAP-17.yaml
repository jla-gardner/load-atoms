    The complete dataset and labels used to train and test the `C-GAP-17 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.094203>`_ 
    interatomic potential for amorphous carbon.
    This dataset was built in an iterative manner, and contains 4,530 structures, covering a wide range of densities, temperatures and degrees of dis/order.
    More detail can be found in the paper's `supplementary information <https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.7453>`__.
