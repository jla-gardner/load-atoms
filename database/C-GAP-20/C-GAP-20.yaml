description: |
    The complete dataset and labels used for training both the `C-GAP-20 <https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/153/3/034702/1062660/An-accurate-and-transferable-machine-learning>`_
    and C-GAP-20-U interatomic potentials for carbon. 
    Original labels were obtained from `CAM.54529 <https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.54529>`_, 
    and the higher level of DFT used for the C-GAP-20-U model was obtained from `CAM.82086 <https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.82086>`_.
