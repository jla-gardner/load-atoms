name: Si-GAP-18
year: 2018
description: |
    The complete dataset used to train the `Si-GAP-18 <https://zenodo.org/records/1250555>`_ model
    from `Machine Learning a General-Purpose Interatomic Potential for Silicon <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.041048>`_.
    The CUR algorithm was used to select representative structures from a larger dataset.
    Energy and force labels were calculated using the PW91 exchange-correlation functional as implemented in :code:`CASTEP`
    (see :code:`II.B: Database` of the paper).
