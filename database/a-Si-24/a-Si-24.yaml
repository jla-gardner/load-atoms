    A dataset of synthetic amorphous Silicon structures, taken from
    `Signatures of paracrystallinity in amorphous silicon <https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16681>`__.
    Each structure is the final snapshot from a unique melt-quench MD trajectory. 
    The combined dataset covers a wide range of quench rates and densities, and includes the labels 
    from the MTP :math:`M_{16}^{''}` potential used to generate the structures.
