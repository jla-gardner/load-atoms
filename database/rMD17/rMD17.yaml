description: |
    A dataset composed of a single MD trajectory for each of 10 molecules.
    Original structures are taken from Chmiela et al., with energy and force
    labels recalculated by Christensen and von Lilienfeld using "the PBE/def2-SVP
    level of theory [with] very tight SCF convergence and [a] very dense DFT
    integration grid". The MD trajectories are presented one at a time, with
    structures within each trajectory in chronological order.
