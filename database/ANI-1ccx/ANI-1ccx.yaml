    The ANI-1ccx dataset comprises an "optimally spanning" subset of the :doc:`/datasets/ANI-1x` dataset,
    with each structure being re-labelled with the total structure energy using the 
    "gold standard" CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory. Internall, files are downloaded from
    `FigShare <https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/The_ANI-1ccx_and_ANI-1x_data_sets_coupled-cluster_and_density_functional_theory_properties_for_molecules/4712477>`__.
