    1,000 randomly sampled training structures, together with 1,000 test structures, for each system from the `MD17 dataset <https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1603015>`_.
    Original data was downloaded from `sgdml.org <http://www.sgdml.org/#datasets>`_.
    Structure selection and data processing was performed using the script available 
    `here <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/database/MD17-1k/process.py>`_.
    As part of this process, energy and force labels have been converted from the original units of kcal/mol and kcal/mol/Å to eV and eV/Å, respectively.
