    The complete dataset used for training the 
    `C-GAP-20U <https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/153/3/034702/1062660/An-accurate-and-transferable-machine-learning>`_
    interatomic potential for carbon.
    Suitably converged labels were obtained with revised DFT settings, see `CAM.840-6 <https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.84096>`_.
