    The training database used to fit the `SiOx-ACE-24 potential <https://zenodo.org/records/10419194>`_ in: 
    `Modelling atomic and nanoscale structure in the silicon-oxygen system through active machine-learning <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45840-9>`_.
    The dataset comprises structures taken from the `Si-GAP-18 <https://jla-gardner.github.io/load-atoms/datasets/Si-GAP-18.html>`__ 
    and `SiO2-GAP-22 <https://jla-gardner.github.io/load-atoms/datasets/SiO2-GAP-22.html>`__ datasets, together
    with new structures generated using an active-learning approach.
