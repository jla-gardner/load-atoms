name: SiO2-GAP-22
year: 2022
description: |
    The training database used to fit the `GAP-22 potential for silica <https://zenodo.org/records/6353684>`_ in: 
    `A Machine-Learned Interatomic Potential for Silica and Its Relation to Empirical Models <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-022-00768-w>`_.
    The dataset was generated using an iterative approach, in some cases driven by an emprical potential. More details are available in the 
    `supplementary information <https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41524-022-00768-w/MediaObjects/41524_2022_768_MOESM1_ESM.pdf>`_.
