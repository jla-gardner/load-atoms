description: |
    The complete dataset used for training the `GST-GAP-22 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41928-023-01030-x>`_ interatomic potential,
    as labelled using the PBE functional.
    This dataset covers a range of compositions along the :math:`\text{GeTe} \rightarrow \text{Sb}_2\text{Te}_3` pseudo-binary line, and
    was created using a two-step iterative process. More details are available in the paper's `supplementary information <https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41928-023-01030-x/MediaObjects/41928_2023_1030_MOESM1_ESM.pdf>`_.
    The original data were obtained from `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/8208202>`_. DFT energy and force labels have been
    renamed to :code:`energy` and :code:`forces` respectively.
