    The ANI-1x dataset is a comprehensive collection of labelled molecular structures designed for training machine learned potentials. 
    ANI-1x was generated using an active learning approach to produce a diverse and useful dataset
    covering the chemical space of organic molecules composed of C, H, N, and O atoms, 
    Accurate energy and force labels are provided for each structure using the :math:`\omega`\ B97x/6-31G(d) level of theory.
    Internall, files are downloaded from
