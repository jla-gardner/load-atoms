description: |
    The complete dataset (``"iter-12-filtered"``) used for training and testing the 
    `GO-MACE-23 <https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202410088>`__ interatomic potential.
    This dataset covers a wide range of graphene-oxide relevant configurations,
    several different stoichiometries, and many different functional groups.
    DFT labels were generated using `CASTEP <https://www.castep.org/>`__ with the PBE functional.
    Original data were obtained from `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/14066557>`__.
    Reference energies for isolated atoms are ``{"C": -148.6811580026, "H": -12.53432584235, "O": -431.6357255604}``.
